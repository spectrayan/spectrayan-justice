{"id": "service in general or a particular class of it.  The section\nenables  the  State  to  take over  particular  class  of  a\nservice,  say, the bus service, and exclude all or  some  of\nthe  persons  doing  business  in  that  class  of  service.\nLearned counsel says that this section confers a wide  power\nbeyond  the  permissible  limits of Art.  19(6)(ii)  of  the\nConstitution.  To state it differently, the argument is that\nwhile Art. 19(6)(ii) does not enable a partial exclusion\n                            649\nof some among the same class of service, s. 68C permits  the\nsaid exclusion.\nThe answer to this argument depends upon the true meaning of\nthe  provisions of the said Article.  Under sub-cl. (ii)  of\nArt.  19(6),  the  State  can make a  law  relating  to  the\ncarrying  on  by  the State or by  a  corporation  owned  or\ncontrolled  by  the  State,  of  any  particular   business,\nindustry  or service, whether to the exclusion, complete  or\npartial, of citizens or otherwise.  Article 19(6) is only  a\nsaving  provision and the law made empowering the  State  to\ncarry on a business is secured from attack on the ground  of\ninfringement  of the fundamental rights of a citizen to  the\nextent  it  does not exceed the limits of the scope  of  the\nsaid  provision.   Sub-clause (ii) is couched in  very  wide\nterms.   Under it the State can make law for carrying  on  a\nbusiness  or service to the exclusion, complete or  partial,\nof  citizens or otherwise.  The law, therefore, can  provide\nfor  carrying  on  a service to the  exclusion  of  all  the\ncitizens; it may, exclude some of the citizens only; it  may\ndo  business in the entire State or a portion of the  State,\nin a specified route or a part thereof The word \" service  \"\nis wide enough to take in not only the general motor service\nbut all the species of motor service.  There are, therefore,\nno limitations on the Stateâ€™s power to make laws  conferring\nmonopoly on it in respect of an area, and person or  persons\nto  be excluded.  In this view, it must be held that s.  68C\ndoes  not exceed the limits prescribed by Art. 19(6)(ii)  of\nthe Constitution.\n\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nPage 6 of 15 \nRe. (3): The next contention is that the provisions of Ch.\nIVA of the Act, and particularly those of s. 68C    thereof,\noffend against Art. 14 of the Constitution.  The argument is\nthat  Ch.   IVA enables the State to make  a  discrimination\nbetween the State Road Transport Corporation on the one hand\nand private operators and private transport undertakings  on\nthe other, and also to make a similar discrimination between\nthe private operators or the private transport undertakings,\nand  that  this  discrimination is  left  to  the  arbitrary\ndiscretion  of the Transport Corporation.  It is  true  that\nthe provisions of this Chapter\n650\nenable  a scheme to be framed conferring a monopoly  on  the\nState  in  respect of transport services to the  partial  or\ncomplete   exclusion   of  other  persons.    However,   the\nprovisions of the scheme do not make any distinction between\nindividuals  operating  a  transport  service  and   private\ntransport  undertakings; they are all treated as  one  class\nand  the  classification  is only  made  between  the  State\nTransport  Undertaking and private  transport  undertakings,\nwhether  the business is carried on by individuals or  firms\nor companies.  The only question, therefore, is whether such\na classification offends against the equality clause of  the\nConstitution.  Article 14 says:\n\" The State shall not deny to any person equality before the\nlaw or the equal protection of the laws within the territory\nof India.\"\nThis doctrine of equality has been so frequently  considered\nby  this  Court  that  it  does  not  require  any   further\nconsideration.  It has been held that this Article does  not\nprohibit  reasonable  classification  for  the  purpose   of\nlegislation,  but such a classification cannot be  arbitrary\nbut  must  be  based upon differences  which  have  rational\nrelation to the object sought to be achieved.  Doubtless  in\nthe present case, the Legislature placed the State Transport\nUndertaking  in a class different from  other  undertakings.\nThe question is whether the classification made in Ch.   IVA\nof the Act is just and has reasonable relation to the object\nof the legislation.  The object of Ch.  IVA, as disclosed by\nthe  provisions of s. 68C, is to provide in the interest  of\nthe  public an efficient, adequate, economical and  properly\ncoordinated road transport service.  To achieve that  object\ns. 68C confers a power on the State Transport Undertaking to\nprepare  a  scheme  to  run  the  service,  whether  to  the\nexclusion,   complete  or  partial,  of  other  persons   or\notherwise.   The  classification  has  certainly  reasonable\nnexus  to  the object sought to be achieved.   Ordinarily  a\nState  Transport  Undertaking, compared with  per.  sons  or\nprivate  undertakings, should be in a better  Position  than\nothers to carry on the said services for the benefit of  the\npublic administratively, financially\n                            651\nand  technically  it can be expected to be in a  far  better\nposition  than  others.  It can provide more  well  equipped\nbuses, give better amenities to the travelling public,  keep\nregular timings, repair or replace the buses in emergencies.\nIt  may  also  employ efficient supervisory  staff  to  keep\nthings  going at an appreciably high standard.  We  are  not\nsuggesting   that  there  are  no  individuals  or   private\ncompanies  who  can efficiently run the  service.   But  the\nState,  compared with individuals, should certainly be in  a\nbetter  position to achieve the object, namely,  to  improve\nthe  road transport service in all its diverse aspects.   In\nsuch  a  situation,  when the  legislature,  which  must  be\npresumed to understand and correctly appreciate the needs of\n\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nPage 7 of 15 \nits  own  people,  makes a classification  between  a  State\nTransport Undertaking and others carrying On the business of\ntransport   services,  we  cannot  say  that  there  is   no\nreasonable basis for such a classification.\nBut  it is said that s. 68C of the Act and other  provisions\nof Ch.  IVA thereof confer an arbitrary power upon the State\nTransport  Undertaking to discriminate  between  individuals\nand  the  said Undertaking between individuals  and  private\nundertakings, and between individuals and individuals.   But\nthe  scheme  of Ch. IVA, which has been considered  by  this\nCourt  in Gullapalli Nageswara Rao v. Andhra  Pradesh  State\nRoad  Transport  Corporation (1), evolves  a  machinery  for\nkeeping  the State Transport Undertaking within  bounds  and\nfrom acting in an arbitrary manner, for s. 68C lays down the\nlegislative policy in clear and understandable terms and the\nState  Transport Undertaking can initiate a scheme only  for\nproviding  an efficient, adequate, economical  and  properly\ncoordinated road transport service.  Another condition which\nit  lays down is that the scheme is necessary in the  public\ninterest.   The  scheme so framed is  published,  with  all-\nnecessary  particulars, in the official Gazette and also  in\nsuch  manner  as the State Government  may  direct;  persons\naffected  by  the  scheme may  file  objections  within  the\nprescribed  time ; the State Government,  after  considering\nthe objections and\n(1)  [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 319.\n652\ngiving   an   opportunity   to  the   objectors   or   their\nrepresentatives   and  the  representatives  of  the   State\nTransport Undertaking to be beard in the matter, may approve\nor modify the scheme; the scheme so approved or modified  is\npublished.   The  rules  framed under the  Act  provide  for\npersonal hearing.  If the State Transport Undertaking  seeks\nto  modify  a  scheme,  it will  have  to  follow  the  same\nprocedure  before doing so: see as. 68C, 68D and 68E of  the", "citation": "", "act": "Motor  Vehicles-Nationalisation of road transport  services- Preparation   and  enforcement   of   schemes-Constitutional validity  of  enactment-Varying frequency  of  services,  if variation  of  â€™the scheme-Validity of  rule-Motor  Vehicles", "description": "These petitions by certain stage carriage permit-holders for appropriate writs quashing seven schemes for nationalisation of  road  transport  services  in  West  Godavari  District, approved and enforced from different dates by the Government of  Andhra  Pradesh, called in question  the  constitutional validity  of  Ch. IVA of the Motor Vehicles  Act,  1939,  as amended by Act 100 of 1956, and the validity of r. 5 of  the Andhra  Pradesh  Motor Vehicles Rules framed  by  the  State Government  under s. 68(1) of the Act and the note in  terms of  the said rule appended to the schemes which was said  to be inconsistent with the Act and was as follows:- \"The frequency of services of any of the notified routes  or within  any  notified area shall, if  necessary,  be  varied having regard to the traffic needs during any period.\" Held, that in view of the decision of this Court in H. C.                             643 Narayanappa v. The State of Mysore, it was no longer open to the  petitioners to contend that the provisions of Ch.   IVA of  the Motor Vehicles Act (IV of 1939), as amended  by  the Central Act 100 of 1956, were ultra vires the powers of  the Parliament. H.   C. Narayanappa v. The State of Mysore, [1960] 3  S.C.R. 742, followed. Nor  was it correct to contend that Ch.  IVA of the Act  was invalid on the ground that it infringed Art. 19(i)(g) of the Constitution  and was not saved by Art. 19(6) as the  powers conferred  on  the State by s. 68C of the Act  exceeded  the limits  of  Art.  19(6)(ii) of  the  Constitution.   Article 19(6)(ii) is couched in very wide terms, the word  â€™serviceâ€™ used  by it is wide enough to include all species  of  motor service  and it does not in any way limit the Statesâ€™  power to  confer  on  itself a monopoly in  respect  any  area  in exclusion of any person or persons. The  only classification that Ch.  IVA of the Act  makes  is between   the  State  Transport  Undertaking   and   private transport undertakings, whether carried on by individuals or firms  or companies, and that classification  is  reasonably connected  with  the  object it has in view.   It  was  not, therefore, correct to say that it contravenes Art. 14 of the http://JUDIS.NIC.IN  SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 15  Constitution.   That Chapter does not confer  any  arbitrary and   discriminatory   power  upon   the   State   Transport Undertaking nor does the quasi-judicial procedure prescribed by it seek to cover such power.  Any mala fide or  collusive exercise  of  the  power, therefore, in  deprivation  of  an individualâ€™s  rights  can only be a ground  for  quashing  a particular  scheme alone but not for declaring  the  chapter void.  Since  that  chapter provides a complete  and  satisfactory machinery for reasonably regulating the exclusion of all  or some of the private operators from a notified area or  route it requires no liberal construction. Gullapalli  Nageswara Rao v. Andhra Pradesh  Road  Transport Corporation, [1959] SUPP. 1 S.C.R. 319, referred to. Saghir  Ahmad  v. The State of U. P., [1955] 1  S.C.R.  707, considered. Official bias inherent in the discharge of a statutory duty, as  has  been pointed out by this Court,  is  distinct  from personal  bias for or against any of the parties.  Since  in the  instant case, the State Road Transport Corporation  was neither  legally  nor factually a department  of  the  State Government and the State Government in deciding the  dispute between  the said undertaking and the operators  of  private buses  was  only  discharging  its  statutory  function,  no question of official bias could arise. Gullapalli  Nageswara  Rao v. The State of  Andhra  Pradesh, [1960]  1 S.C.R. 580 and H. C. Narayanappa v. The  State  of Mysore, [1960] 3 S.C.R. 742, considered. 644 The  observations made by this Court in Srinivasa  Reddy  v. The  State of Mysore, in regard to piecemeal  implementation of a scheme were directed against any abuse of power by  way of  discrimination  as between operators  and  operators  in respect  of  a single scheme.  Since the  seven  schemes  in question  were  intended  to  avoid  the  vice  inherent  in piecemeal  implementation of a single scheme and were  meant to be implementated in their entirety from different  dates, those observations did not apply to them. Srinivasa Reddy v. The State of Mysore, [1960] 2 S.C.R  130, explained. There can be no doubt that r. 5 of the Andhra Pradesh  Motor Vehicles   Rules  in  conferring  on  the  State   Transport Undertaking  the  power to vary the frequency  of  services, gave  it the power to effect a substantial  modification  in the scheme permissible only under s. 68E of the Act, and  as such  the  rule must be declared void.  But since  the  note appended  to  the  schemes  in  pursuance  of  the  rule  is severable  from  the schemes, it should be deleted  and  the schemes must be declared valid. The  word â€™routeâ€™ in s. 68C of the Act does not refer  to  a preexisting route.  It is permissible under that section  to frame  a  scheme  in respect of any area  or  route  or  any portions thereof, or a new route, since there is no inherent inconsistency between an â€™areaâ€™ and a â€™routeâ€™.", "verdict": "in view of the decision of this Court in H.

Prior  to  the  Revolution,   the\n              Colonies,  being in effect under the  laws  of\n              England, were accustomed to the   exercise  of\n              it in the various forms, as they may be  found\n              in the English books.  They were of course  to\n\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nPage 31 of 43 \n              be  applied  as occasions occurred,  and  they\n              constituted  a  part of the  jurisprudence  of\n              Anglo-America.   At that time of the  adoption\n              of  the Constitution, American statesmen  were\n              conversant with the prerogatives exercised  by\n              the  Crown.   Hence when the  words  to  grant\n              pardons  were used in the  Constitution,  they\n              convey to the mind the authority as  exercised\n              by  the English Crown, or its  representatives\n              in the Colonies.  At that time both Englishmen\n              and Americans attached the same meaning to the\n              words  \"  pardon \". In  the  convention  which\n              framed the Constitution, no effort was made to\n              define or change its meaning, although it  was\n              limited in cases of impeachment.\n               We  must then give the word the same  meaning\n              as  prevailed here and in England at the  time\n              it found a place in the Constitution.

The  language of the Constitution  cannot  be\ninterpreted safely except by reference to the common law and\nto British institutions as they were when the instrument was\nframed  and  adopted.   The statesmen  and  lawyers  of  the\nConvention,  who  submitted it to the  ratification  of  the\nConvention of the thirteen states, were born and brought  up\nin  the atmosphere of the common law, and thought and  spoke\nin  its vocabulary.  They were familiar with other forms  of\ngovernment  recent  and  ancient,  and  indicated  in  their\ndiscussions earnest study and consideration of many of them,\nbut when they came to put their conclusions into the form of\nfundamental  law in a compact draft, they expressed them  in\nterms of the common law,\n(1)  69 L. Ed 527, 530, 532, 535.\n545\nconfident   that  they  could  be  shortly   and   earnestly\nunderstood \".\nAccording  to the American as also Indian  Constitution  the\npower  as  given  to the President is not  to  reprieve  and\npardon  but that he shall have power to grant reprieves  and\npardons  for  offenses against the United States  except  in\ncases of impeachment.  Wayne, J., in Ex parte Well8 (1-)  at\npage 425 has explained the difference between the meaning of\nthese two expressions.  \"The first convoys only the idea  of\nan  absolute power as to the purpose or object for which  it\nis given.  The real language of the constitution is general,\nthat is, common to the class of pardons known in the law  as\nsuch  whatever they may be by their denomination.   We  have\nshown  that  conditional pardon is one of  them.   A  single\nremark from the power to grant reprieves will illustrate the\npoint.   That  is not only to be used to  delay  a  judicial\nsentence  when the President shall think the merits  of  the\ncase  or some cause connected with the offender may  require\nit,   but   it  also  extends  to   cases   ex   necessitate\nlegis  ...................... Though the reprieve in  either\ncase  produces delay in the execution of a sentence  \",  the\nreprieves  in  the two cases are different  in  their  legal\ncharacter  and different as to the causes which  may  induce\nthe exercise of the power to reprieve.\nIn  India also the makers of the Constitution were  familiar\n\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nPage 32 of 43 \nwith  English institutions and the powers of  English  Kings\nand the exercise of their power both by the Governor General\nand the Governors of British India and of its provinces.  It\nwill  be legitimate to draw on English law for  guidance  in\nthe  construction of the articles dealing with the power  of\nthe  President  and  of the Governor in  regard  to  pardons\nincluding the other forms of clemency comprised in. the  two\narticles.   It  will not be inappropriate to  say  that  the\nframers  of the Indian Constitution were not  only  familiar\nand trained in British Jurisprudence but were familiar  with\nthe  American  Constitution  and they  were  drafting  their\nConstitution in English language and therefore to draw  upon\nthe American parallel would be wholly legitimate.\n(1)  15 L. Ed. 421, 425.\n546\nThe  history  of the prerogative of  pardons  and  reprieves\nshows  that  the  power of the executive in  the  matter  of\npardons   and   reprieves  and  other   forms   of   pardons\nirrespective of the name used is of the widest amplitude and\nis plenary in nature and can be exercised at any time  after\nthe  commission of the offence.  The power of the  executive\nis an act of grace and clemency.   It  is  a  sovereign   or\ngovernmental power which ina monarchy is inherent in  the\nKing and in a Republicin  the  State or  the  people  and\nwhich  may, by the Constitution, be conferred on an  officer\nor  a department.  It is an executive power of the  Governor\nand  it is the same as was exercised by the colonial  Gover-\nnors in America 67 C. J. S. 565.\nWayne, J., in the matter of Ex parte Wells (1) has described\nit  as an act of mercy and an act of clemency applicable  to\npardons  of  every kind and form.  Field, J.,  in  Ex  parte\nGarland  (2) termed it the benign prerogative of mercy.   It\nis  the power for avoiding the execution of the judgment  by\nreprieve  or pardon whereof the former is temporary and  the\nlatter permanent.

Soon thereafter  he was arrested on a charge of murder  under  s. 302 of the â€™Indian Penal Code and was placed, and  continued to remain, in naval custody all along during his trial.   In due  course  he  was placed on trial by a  jury  before  the Sessions Judge, Greater Bombay, in which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty by a majority; but the Sessions  judge disagreeing with the verdict of the jury made a reference to the  High Court which convicted the petitioner under s.  302 of  the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to  imprisonment for  life.  On the same day when the High  Court  pronounced its  judgment the Governor of Bombay passed an  order  under Art.  161  of  the  Constitution  of  India  suspending  the sentence  passed  by  the  High  Court  of  Bombay  on   the", "verdict": "the Governor had no power to grant the suspension of sentence for the period during which the matter was  sub- judice  in this Court.  The Governorâ€™s order suspending  the sentence  could  only operate until the matter  became  sub- judice  in  this  Court on the filing of  the  petition  for special leave to appeal whereupon this Court being in seisin of the matter would consider whether 0. XXI, r. 5 should  be applied  or  the  petitioner should  be  exempted  from  the operation thereof as prayed for.  It would then be for  this Court  to pass such orders as it thought fit as  to  whether bail  should  be  granted to the  petitioner  or  he  should surrender to his sentence or to pass such other order as the court deemed fit in the circumstances of the case. On the principle of harmonious construction and- to avoid  a possible conflict between the powers given under Art. 161 to the  Governor and under Art. 142 to the Supreme Court,  both of  which  are absolute and unfettered in  their  respective fields  of operation, it must be held that.   Art.  161,does not  deal  with the suspension of sentence during  the  time that  Art. 142 is in operation and the matter is  sub-judice in the Supreme Court. Per KAPUR J. (dissenting)-The language of Art. 161 is of the widest  amplitude.   It is plenary and an act of  grace  and clemency  and may be termed as benign prerogative of  mercy; The power of pardon is absolute and exercisable at any time. Rules framed under Art.  145 are subordinate legislation and cannot   override  the  provisions  of  Art.  161   of   the Constitution  itself.  While the Governorâ€™s power  to  grant pardon is a power specially conferred upon him as was vested in the British Governor in British days, the power given  to the  Court under Art. 142(1) is a general power  exercisable for  doing complete justice in any cause or matter,  and  if they  deal with the same matter then Art. 161  must  prevail over  Art. 142(1). The two powers may have the  same  effect but they operate in distinct fields on different  principles taking wholly irreconcilable factors into consideration. The  action  taken by the executive being  the  exercise  of overriding power is not subject to judicial review.

XIII of 1954).", "description": "The  Assam  Taxation (on goods carried by Roads  and  Inland  Waterways)  Act, 1954, was passed under Entry 56 of List  II  of  Seventh  Schedule to the Constitution.   The  appellants  contended  that  the  Act  violated  the  freedom  of  trade  guaranteed by Art. 301 Of the Constitution and as it was not  passed   after  obtaining  the  previous  sanction  of   the  President  as  required by Art. 304(b) it was  ultra  vires.  The  respondent urged that taxing laws were not governed  by  Part  XIII (which contained Arts. 301 and 304) but  only  by  Part XII and in the alternative that the provisions of  Part  XIII applied only to such legislative entries in the Seventh  Schedule  as  dealt specifically with  trade,  commerce  and  intercourse.  Held, (per Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo and Das Gupta, JJ.)  that  the  Act violated Art. 30i and since it did not comply  with  the  provisions of Art. 304(b) it was ultra vires and  void.  The freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse guaranteed by  Art.  301  was wider than that contained in S.  297  Of  the  Government of India Act, 1935, and it included freedom  from  tax laws also.  Article 301 provides that the flow of  trade  shall run smooth and unhampered by any restriction either at  the  boundaries of the States or at any other points  inside  the  States themselves ; and if any Act imposes  any  direct  restrictions  on  the  movement of  goods  it  attracts  the  provisions  of Art. 301, and its validity can  be  sustained  only  if it satisfied the requirements of Art. 302  or  Art.  304.   The  operation of Art. 301 cannot  be  restricted  to  legislation  under  the  Entries  dealing  with  trade   and  commerce.   The  Assam  Act directly  affected  the  freedom  contemplated by Art. 301.  Ramjilal v. Income-tax Officer, Mohindargarh, [1951]  S.C.R.  127,  M.  P. V. Sundararamier & Co. v.

Cowan,  (1932)  A.C.  542,  referred to.  Per  Sinha, C. J.-The Assam Act did not contravene Art.  301  and  was not ultra vires.  Neither the one extreme  position  that  Art.  301 included freedom from all taxation  nor  the  other  that taxation was wholly outside the purview of  Art.  301 was correct.  The freedom conferred by Art. 301 did  not  mean  freedom  from taxation simpliciter but only  from  the  erection  of trade barriers, tariff walls and imposts  which  had a deleterious effect on the free flow of trade, commerce  and  intercourse.   The  Assam  Act  was  a  taxing  statute  simpliciter and did not suffer from any of the vices against  which Part XIII of the Constitution was intended.  Ramjilal v. Income-tax Officer, Mohindargarh, [1951] S.C.R.  127, referred to.  Further,  the impugned Act was within the competence of  the  State Legislature and fell directly within Entry 56 of  List  11 ; it was not in conflict with the Tea Act Of 1953 enacted  by Parliament; it did not contravene Art.  14 and it was not  extra-territorial in operation. http://JUDIS.NIC.IN  SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 47   The Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bihar, [1958]  S.C.R. 1355, followed.  Per  Shah,  J.-The  Assam Act  infringed  the  guarantee  of  freedom of trade and commerce under Art. 301 and as the Bill  was not moved with the previous sanction of the President as  required  by Art. 304(b) nor was it validated by the  assent  of  the President under Art. 255(c), it was ultra vires  and  void.    Article  301  guarantees  freedom  in  its   widest  amplitude,  freedom  from prohibition,  control,  burden  or  impediment in commercial intercourse.  The freedom  includes  not  only  freedom  from discriminative  tariffs  and  trade  barriers   but   also  from  all  taxation   on   commercial  intercourse.    Part   XIII  of  the   Constitution   places  restrictions  upon  the legislative power granted  by  Arts.  245,  246  and  248 and the  Lists  and  these  restrictions  include burdens in the nature of taxation.  James  v. Commonwealth of Australia, L.R. (1936)  A.C.  578,  referred to.", "verdict": "the  Act contemplated imposition  of  a  tax  on  transport  or carriage of goods within the Meaning of  entry  56  of List II and did not amount to interference  with  the  freedom of trade and commerce within the meaning of Art. 301  of  the  Constitution ; that the pith and substance  of  the  impugned Act was that it was a taxing legislation which  was  not  directly concerned with trade and commerce,  though  it  might indirectly entrench on the field of trade and commerce  and  that  Art. 301 was not directly concerned  with  taxing  laws.   He also held that the impost levied by the  Act  was  not  in the nature of an excise duty and that there  was  no  substance in the contention that it encroached upon entry 84  of the Union List 1. It was also held that the impugned  Act  did  not, in any way, come in conflict with the  control  of  the tea industry  818  introduced  by the Central Legislation, namely, the Tea  Act  XXIX of 1953.  Ram Labhaya, J., examined the provisions of the impugned Act  in great detail and came to the conclusion that the  element  of  carriage was expressly made a condition of liability  to  tax   under  the  impugned  Act  and  it   was,   therefore,  distinguishable  from  a duty of excise  and  came  directly  under entry 56 of List 11.  On the crucial question  arising  in  this case, his conclusion was that taxation per  se  has  not  the  effect  of abridging  or  curtailing  the  freedom  contemplated  by Art. 301 ; that Arts. 302 and 304  restrict  the  powers of Parliament and the State Legislatures in  the  matter of legislation under entries 42 of List 1, 26 of List  11  and  33 of List III and that  restrictions  properly  so  called on the movement of goods and traffic must find  their  justification  from  the  provisions of  Part  XIII  of  the  Constitution  ;  that the impugned Act  made  provision  for  taxation which did not directly impinge upon the freedom  of  trade,  commerce and intercourse within the meaning of  Art.  301.  His view also was that in some cases taxation may have  the effect of placing restrictions on movement of goods  and  traffic,  and  if it has that effect, it  comes  within  the", "judgementDate": "1960-08-16", "source_file": "-0___jonew__judis__150.pdf"}
